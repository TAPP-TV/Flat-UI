# [Flat UI Free](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/)

Flat UI is a beautiful theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). We have redesigned many of its components to look flat in every pixel.

To get started, check out [getting started page](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/docs/getting-started.html) or follow instructions below.


## Quick start

Three quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI/archive/2.2.0.zip).
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI.git`.
- Install with [Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install flat-ui`.

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install dependencies.

Read the [getting started page](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/docs/getting-started.html) for information on the framework contents.

Examples: <https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI/tree/master/docs/examples>.
